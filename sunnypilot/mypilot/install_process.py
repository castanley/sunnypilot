"""Idempotently turn a fresh upstream sunnypilot tree into the MyPilot device image.

Run from the fork repo root after ``assemble.py`` has overlaid ``sunnypilot/mypilot/`` (the agent)
and the base's UI files. This script encodes EVERY device-side edit that makes MyPilot MyPilot, so
the published image is the reproducible output of ``assemble.py build`` — never a hand patch that a
rebuild would silently drop. It:

  1. registers the MyPilot agent (mypilotd) as a non-critical, import-safe ``PythonProcess`` and
     fixes the registration so it always lands in ``managed_processes``;
  2. tears down sunnylink — removes the five cloud phone-home daemons and the now-orphaned helper
     shims/import — so the device never connects to ``athena.sunnylink.ai`` / ``stg.api.sunnypilot.ai``;
  3. force-disables the in-UI sunnylink worker, hides its sidebar status, and skips its onboarding
     consent screen (the ``SunnylinkEnabled`` param defaults "1" and can't be changed on a prebuilt
     ``params_pyx.so``, so we override at the read sites instead);
  4. rebrands the user-visible "sunnypilot" strings to "MyPilot" and points Terms at mypilot.me;
  5. swaps the mici sunnylink settings panel for the MyPilot Link panel (the UI files are vendored
     by assemble.py); and
  6. registers the on-screen pairing alert key.

DESIGN: every edit is idempotent (re-running is a no-op) and FAIL-LOUD — if an expected anchor is
missing (e.g. an upstream refactor moved it), we raise so the build fails instead of silently
shipping an image that re-enables phone-home or never launches the agent. We use a plain
``PythonProcess`` (not ``DaemonProcess``, which needs a PID param declared in the compiled
``params_keys.h`` — impossible on a prebuilt branch). No driving/safety code is touched.

The SSH-access hook + the RAM HD car port are PRIVATE per-build layers applied on top of this; they
are intentionally NOT here (this produces the clean, publishable image).
